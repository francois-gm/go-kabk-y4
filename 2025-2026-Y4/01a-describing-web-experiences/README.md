# Describing web experiences (1h15)

A quick exercice about looking at and describing web experiences

## 1) Show us a coding project you realized in your previous study years (30min)

a) Describe your project in **three sentences** and under **one minute**. Tell us what the project is about, what it does, and how it technically works.

b) Then try to answer these questions in **three more sentences** and **under one more minute**:

- What positive qualities can you see in it?
- What did you afterwards realize could have worked better?
- How did you feel about your learning process doing this project? Did you feel confident, did you enjoy the process, and what did you learn?
- If you would do it again, would you proceed differently? If yes/no, how and why?

**5 minutes** for preparing, **2 minutes** each for presenting.

## 2) The Good, The Bad, and the... (45min) (two rounds)

This time, you'll be assigned a website and will be assigned either to take the 'good' (positive/supportive) side or the 'bad' (negative/critical) side. Please elaborate on the five points below, with one (short) sentence each. For each points, are the design choices 'adequate' according to you and, if not, how would you think it should be (in terms of affordance)? Try to convince us, but also be *fair play* ;)

1. Appearance
2. Movement
3. Structure
4. Navigation
5. Functionality (does it do what it should)
6. Accessibility

After you have your arguments ready, both sides will, in a exchange, present their (counter) arguments. Then, the website will be revealed to the rest of the group.

**8 minutes** for writing, **1 minutes** per person per website presentation.
