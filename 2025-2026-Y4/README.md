# Research document as a website

## The assignment

- Conceptualize, design and code a web version of your research document.
- Work with code in your website sketching process (we won't look at your .pdf, "indesign" or "figma" website sketches proposal).
- Publish (deploy) it on the KABK's GitHub repo.
- Ensure it is archivable on the university's *researchcatalogue.net*.

## Class structure

### Planning

- **Schedule**: (almost) **every Thursday**, from **February 5th** up to **April 2nd**.
- **Hours, group A**: **9h15 to 13h15** (class) + 13h30 to 15h30 (signups).
- **Hours, group B**: 11h15 to 13h15 (signups) + **13h30 to 17h30** (class).
- **Duration**: **6 classes** spread over 8 weeks.
- **Deadline**: final delivery on **Thursday April 2nd (TBC)**.

### Activities

- Two first February classes (**5th, 12th**), workshop structure, reviewing and expanding on coding notions for the assignment.
- End February and March: mostly Individual feedback classes (**sign-up** sheet, **10–15 minutes individual time slots**)...
- ... but the possibility of making small groups feedback (4-5 people, sign-up sheet, 60 minutes) as well.
- **Self-directed** (if not meeting for feedback, you'd be expected to advance/work on your project).
- In order to pass, attendance is set at 80% of classes (so 6 classes out of 8).

### Working methodology

Questions to ask **soon**:

- Which **types of content** do I want to work with in my research? Lots of visual materials, maybe videos, or audio? Or mainly textual?
- Which **type of writing / tone?** An academic research will command an appropriate use of footnotes. Something akin of a *deambulation* at the edges of theory and fiction might have looser or expressive typographic elements.
- What are my **actual abilities**, in relation to this assignment? **You don't need to have advanced coding skills to "succeed" the assignment**, what is important is to come up with a proposal up to your abilities that **deserves your content**.

Questions to ask **at some point later**:

- **How can my topic translate into visual design choices?** *Shall my topic translate into visual design choices?* Which types of ingredients can I play with (*color, typography, layout, interaction patterns...*).
- Which **types of functionalities** could provide an enriched experience while **being true to my content**?
- Are my design choices **appropriate for any screen sizes**? Would my website be accessible to most users and most usage contexts?

Questions to ask **before delivering your project**:

- **Bring your thesis website for a test drive**. Navigate on your website and reflect on your 'user' experience. Also **let your friends try your website, and observe them while doing it**. Criterias to take into account: *intuitive patterns, loads fast, optimized content and media, legible sizes depending on screen sizes, right timing for animations and transitions, accessible...* Based on these experiences, see remaining details that can be improved.
- Can my thesis website be **archived** through the university research portal (assignment requirement)? In most circumstances it will be, you will need to make sure your website is *static* (as self-contained *html* document with its contained ressources), and be mindful about how you use *Javascript* (if you use it).

### Milestones

↓ (February) You attend most classes, you do the activities, and you're familiar with the general structures you can use for your website. <br>
↓ (February) You are organizing your working content for the assignment (placeholder materials). <br>
↓ (end February) You're familiar with your research topic and your angle, you have conceptual ideas of *potentialities*. <br>
↓ (end February) You've started working on your website, sketching in code. <br>
↓ (from March 1st) You are fully committed to **coding/developing your actual research document website.** <br>
↓ (mid March) Your website is structurally sound, you are now adjusting elements more precisely. <br>
↓ (end March) You are debugging / fine-tuning details across several screen sizes (mobile/desktop), have your actual content, and you are deploying on GitHub. <br>
↓ (early April) (delivery deadline) **Your website is online (yay!)**

## Research documents landing page (non-graded)

- We'll need a small group to make a landing page for this year's research document websites. As examples, here are the landing pages of [2025](https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-25/), [2024](https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-24/), [2023](https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-23/), [2022](https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-22/), [2021](https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-21/), [2020](https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-20/), and [2019](https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-19/). It would be nice to have this sorted out for the **end of February**.
